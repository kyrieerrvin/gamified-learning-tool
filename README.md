## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NLP model connected to Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Data Storage**: Firebase Firestore

## NLP Integration Details

### Architecture

The NLP integration consists of two main components:

1. **Dedicated NLP API Server** (`app.py`)
   - Flask-based RESTful API for NLP processing
   - Loads the CalamanCy model for Tagalog language analysis
   - Provides endpoints for game data, POS tagging, and answer verification

2. **Next.js Frontend** (via `nlpService.ts`)
   - Communicates with the NLP API through client services
   - Provides fallback mechanisms when the API is unavailable

### API Endpoints

The NLP API provides the following endpoints:

- **GET `/health`** - Health check endpoint
- **GET `/api/pos-game?difficulty=medium`** - Generate game data with optional difficulty parameter
- **POST `/api/analyze`** - Analyze a Tagalog sentence for POS tagging
- **POST `/api/verify`** - Verify if a selected answer is correct

## Firebase Integration

### Authentication

The application uses Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts:
- Email and password authentication
- Google sign-in integration
- Secure token management

### Security Rules

The application uses Firestore Security Rules to ensure that:
- Users can only read and write their own data
- Challenge results are immutable once created
- Admin functions are protected

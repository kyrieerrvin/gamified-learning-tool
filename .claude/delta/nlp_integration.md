# NLP Integration Delta Summary

## Change Overview
**Commit:** cd5d0f6 integrated NLP to multiple choice game  
**Previous Commit:** de2d689 Update README.md  
**Date:** 2025-03-09

## Key Files Changed

### Added
- `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/verify/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/challenges/pos-game/route.ts`
- `src/services/nlpService.ts`
- `start-nlp.sh`
- `test-connection.py`
- `test-nlp.py`
- `app.py`

### Modified
- `src/services/gameService.ts`
- `src/components/challenges/multiple-choice/PartsOfSpeechGame.tsx`
- `src/store/gameStore.ts`
- `src/types/index.ts`

## Semantic Changes

### Architecture Changes
- Added Python NLP backend with calamancy model for Tagalog language processing
- Implemented API routes to interface between Next.js frontend and Python backend
- Created service layer for NLP operations

### API Changes
- Added `/api/analyze` endpoint for text analysis
- Added `/api/verify` endpoint for answer verification
- Added `/api/challenges/pos-game` endpoint for generating parts of speech challenges

### Feature Changes
- Parts of Speech game now uses NLP model to generate questions
- Game dynamically generates grammatical challenges based on Tagalog text
- Answer validation uses intelligent matching rather than exact string comparison

### Type System Changes
- Added `AnalysisResult` interface for NLP text analysis responses
- Added `VerificationResult` interface for answer verification responses
- Extended `Challenge` type to include difficulty levels

## Behavioral Changes

### 1. Challenge Generation
**Before:** Multiple-choice challenges were hardcoded or randomly selected from a predefined set  
**After:** Challenges are dynamically generated by the NLP model based on Tagalog text analysis

### 2. Answer Validation
**Before:** Answer checking used exact string matching  
**After:** Answer validation uses the NLP model to intelligently assess correctness with confidence scores

### 3. Error Handling
**Before:** Basic error handling with generic messages  
**After:** More robust error handling with specific error messages for NLP service connection issues

## Dependencies
- Added Python dependency: calamancy (Tagalog NLP model)
- Added Python dependency: flask (for API server)
- Added Python dependency: flask-cors (for cross-origin requests)

## Implementation Details

### NLP Service Integration
The key integration happens in `nlpService.ts`, which provides two main functions:

```typescript
// Analyzes text to extract parts of speech and other linguistic features
export const analyzeText = async (text: string): Promise<AnalysisResult> => {
  // Implementation details...
};

// Verifies if a user's answer matches the expected result
export const verifyAnswer = async (
  answer: string, 
  expected: string
): Promise<VerificationResult> => {
  // Implementation details...
};
```

### Game Service Changes
The game service was updated to use the NLP service for challenge generation:

```typescript
export const generateChallenge = async (
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard' = 'easy'
): Promise<Challenge> => {
  // Uses nlpService.analyzeText to generate a new challenge
};

export const checkAnswer = async (
  userAnswer: string, 
  challengeId: string
): Promise<AnswerResult> => {
  // Uses nlpService.verifyAnswer to check user's answer
};
```

## Performance Implications
- Initial challenge generation may take 1-2 seconds due to NLP processing
- The Python backend should be running for the game to function properly
- Memory usage increased due to the NLP model

## Testing Considerations
- Added test scripts: `test-connection.py` and `test-nlp.py`
- Use `./start-nlp.sh` to start the Python backend before running the app

## Security Considerations
- NLP server only listens on localhost:6000
- Implemented request validation to prevent injection attacks
- Limited NLP model capabilities to educational functions only

## Design Decisions and Reasoning

### Why Python Backend + Next.js Frontend?
The calamancy NLP model is a Python library without JavaScript bindings. A separate Python service allows us to use this specialized Tagalog NLP model while keeping the benefits of the Next.js frontend for UI and routing.

### Why Dynamic Challenge Generation?
Dynamic challenge generation allows for:
1. Virtually unlimited unique challenges
2. Better adaptation to different difficulty levels
3. More natural language examples from real Tagalog text

### Why Confidence Scores in Verification?
Confidence scores allow for partial credit and more nuanced feedback, which is important for language learning where answers might be technically correct but uncommon or have multiple valid interpretations.
